excerpt: 'We propose an IPCA latent factor model for pricing currency option returns. The model connects time-varying factor loadings with changing economic conditions on currency, option and the world economy. It consistently outperforms existing models in explaining currency straddle returns, with a more powerful pricing kernel for asset pricing. We also propose a new risk-based option momentum strategy that outperforms traditional return-based option momentum substantially, with a much greater Sharpe ratio. It is driven by risk and explains the traditional momentum, thereby providing a rational justification for the latter. Overall, our model offers novel economic insights and sets a new benchmark for understanding anomalies in the currency options market.'
